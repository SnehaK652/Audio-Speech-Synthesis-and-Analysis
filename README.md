Driving Experience Enhancement System ðŸš—ðŸŽµ
This repository contains a system designed to enhance the driving experience through real-time audio analysis, situational awareness, and driver emotion detection using machine learning techniques.

Key Highlights:
  Real-Time Audio Analysis: Processes environmental audio data to improve awareness and safety.
  Driver Condition Detection: Identifies driver emotions to assist in creating a safer and more comfortable driving environment.
  Audio Classification:
  Extracted MFCC coefficients for feature representation.
  Optimized feature extraction parameters for improved model performance.
  Classified audio segments into categories such as music, traffic, and talking with high accuracy.
  Dataset labeling, training, and testing.
  Achieved accurate predictions through iterative optimization of features and models.

This project demonstrates the integration of machine learning and real-time signal processing to revolutionize the driving experience.
